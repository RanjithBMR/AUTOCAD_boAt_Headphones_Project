# AUTOCAD_boAt_Headphones_Project

This is a simple project to familiarize with AUTOCAD and its working. A boAt headphone was taken as the object and its dimensions were carefully analyzed and drawn both on paper as well as on AUTOCAD Software.

Difficulties faced while drawing:
 1) Dimensions were too small and measuring each dimension proved to be a time-consuming process as none of the dimensions are approximations in our drawing; all are accurate and precise
 2) Drawing the symbol of boAt proved challenging as matching the dimensions with the projections was quite difficult and it involved lots of commands such as lines, fillets and circles
 3) Drawing the symbols such as volume up, volume down & phone buttons were quite hard as the dimensions were extremely small and the symbols had quite challenging commands such as fillets and arcs
 4) Since our projections has lots of minor detailing, it proved hard to project each view symmetrically along with the other views
